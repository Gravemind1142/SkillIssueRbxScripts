## Deaths Stats without leaderstats
Plenty of bases do not track deaths at all, for various reasons. Use [this example Config ModuleScript](DeathsConfig.lua) to track deaths in the background without displaying it in-game.

## Multiple Roblox Teams as one "Team"
Some groups separate their members into different roblox teams, but still play the same in-game objective as one "team". Use [this example Config ModuleScript](MultipleTeamsConfig.lua) to let Skill Issue interpret multiple Roblox teams as one "team".
